Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad

[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.
Gaff: You've done a man's job, sir. I guess your through, huh?
Deckard: Finished.
Gaff: Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Holden: Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.
Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon: Sure.
Holden: One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon: That's the hotel.
Holden: What?
Leon: Where I live.
Holden: Nice place?
Leon: Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden: No, just warming you up, that's all.
Leon: Oh. It's not fancy or anything.
Holden: You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of the
sudden-
Leon: Is this the test now?
Holden: Yes. You're in a desert walking along in the sand when all of
the sudden you look down-
Leon: What one?
Holden: What?
Leon: What desert?
Holden: It doesn't make any difference what desert, it's completely
hypothetical.
Leon: But how come I'd be there?
Holden: Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself, who
knows? You look down and you see a tortoise, Leon, it's crawling
toward you-
Leon: Tortoise, what's that?
Holden: Know what a turtle is?
Leon: Of course.
Holden: Same thing.
Leon: I've never seen a turtle. (pause) But I understand what you
mean.
Holden: You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have

Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.

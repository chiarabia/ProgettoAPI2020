filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?
[scene change...] [Deckard uses the machine thing]
Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
Holden: Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself, who
knows? You look down and you see a tortoise, Leon, it's crawling
toward you-
Leon: Tortoise, what's that?
Holden: Know what a turtle is?
Leon: Of course.
Holden: Same thing.
Leon: I've never seen a turtle. (pause) But I understand what you
mean.
Holden: You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.

Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.

Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my

[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
in a fail-safe device.
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.

Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.

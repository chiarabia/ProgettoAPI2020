Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm

Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few

Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.

Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.

been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?

in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.

Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.

Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a

Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you

just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.
Gaff: You've done a man's job, sir. I guess your through, huh?
Deckard: Finished.
Gaff: Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
Deckard: Rachael? Rachael? Rachael?
[Deckard uncovers Rachael.]
Deckard: Do you love me?
Rachael: I love you.
Deckard: Do you trust me?
Rachael: I trust you.
Deckard: Rachael?
[Deckard picks up paper unicorn.]
Gaff (memory): Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
Deckard (voice-over): Gaff had been there, and let her live. Four
years, he figured. He was wrong. Tyrell had told me Rachael was
special: no termination date. I didn't know how long we had together,

139,422c
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.

[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.

Leon: Of course.
Holden: Same thing.
Leon: I've never seen a turtle. (pause) But I understand what you
mean.
Holden: You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.
Leon: Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write
them down for you?
Holden: The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without
your help, but you're not helping.
Leon: What do you mean I'm not helping?
Holden: I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? (pause) They're
just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.
(pause) Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good
things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.
Leon: Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)

newspaper]

chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate...
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...
Deckard (voice-over): They don't advertise for killers in the
newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer.
Overhead blimp: Use your new friend as a

Deckard: Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.
Deckard (voice over): Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold
fish.
Gaff: Hey, idi-wa.
Chinese dude: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.
Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.

bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.

Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?

eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.

Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.

shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?
[scene change...] [Deckard uses the machine thing]
Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57

[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
.

Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?

hypothetical.
Leon: But how come I'd be there?
Holden: Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself, who
knows? You look down and you see a tortoise, Leon, it's crawling
toward you-
Leon: Tortoise, what's that?
Holden: Know what a turtle is?
Leon: Of course.
Holden: Same thing.
Leon: I've never seen a turtle. (pause) But I understand what you
mean.
Holden: You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.
Leon: Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write
them down for you?
Holden: The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without
your help, but you're not helping.
Leon: What do you mean I'm not helping?
Holden: I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? (pause) They're
just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.
(pause) Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good
things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.
Leon: Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
[cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on Deckard, reading a
newspaper]
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate...
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...
Deckard (voice-over): They don't advertise for killers in the
newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer.
Overhead blimp: Use your new friend as a
[Deckard walks over to Chinese carry-out stand]
Deckard: Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.
Deckard (voice over): Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold
fish.
Gaff: Hey, idi-wa.
Chinese dude: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.
Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57

Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']

Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...

Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.
Gaff: You've done a man's job, sir. I guess your through, huh?
Deckard: Finished.
Gaff: Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
Deckard: Rachael? Rachael? Rachael?
[Deckard uncovers Rachael.]
Deckard: Do you love me?
Rachael: I love you.

come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.

in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.

Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?

Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like

Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.

Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.

Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.

knows? You look down and you see a tortoise, Leon, it's crawling
toward you-
Leon: Tortoise, what's that?
Holden: Know what a turtle is?
Leon: Of course.
Holden: Same thing.
Leon: I've never seen a turtle. (pause) But I understand what you
mean.
Holden: You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.
Leon: Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write
them down for you?
Holden: The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without
your help, but you're not helping.
Leon: What do you mean I'm not helping?
Holden: I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? (pause) They're
just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.
(pause) Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good
things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.
Leon: Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
[cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on Deckard, reading a
newspaper]
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate...
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...
Deckard (voice-over): They don't advertise for killers in the
newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer.
Overhead blimp: Use your new friend as a
[Deckard walks over to Chinese carry-out stand]
Deckard: Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.
Deckard (voice over): Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold
fish.
Gaff: Hey, idi-wa.
Chinese dude: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.
Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.

Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.

longevity, those things. You saw them?

Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?

Deckard: I dreamt music.

know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.

Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.

workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.
.

Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a

Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.

Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.

Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?

slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.

Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.

can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.

in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.

Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.

Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?

Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.

corrupted man.

Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they

you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.

Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.

[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.

am tomorrow.

Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.

eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?

Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.

Leon: Of course.
Holden: Same thing.
Leon: I've never seen a turtle. (pause) But I understand what you
mean.
Holden: You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.
Leon: Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write
them down for you?
Holden: The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without
your help, but you're not helping.
Leon: What do you mean I'm not helping?
Holden: I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? (pause) They're
just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.

Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I

department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does

Leon: What desert?
Holden: It doesn't make any difference what desert, it's completely
hypothetical.
Leon: But how come I'd be there?

Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?
[scene change...] [Deckard uses the machine thing]
Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57
to 19. Track 45 left. Stop. Enhance 15 to 23. Give me a hard copy
right there.
[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?

822,845d
87,93c
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--

Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?

Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
.

designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.

Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.

Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.

Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!

Holden: It doesn't make any difference what desert, it's completely
hypothetical.
Leon: But how come I'd be there?
Holden: Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself, who
knows? You look down and you see a tortoise, Leon, it's crawling
toward you-
Leon: Tortoise, what's that?
Holden: Know what a turtle is?
Leon: Of course.
Holden: Same thing.
Leon: I've never seen a turtle. (pause) But I understand what you
mean.
Holden: You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.
Leon: Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write
them down for you?
Holden: The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without
your help, but you're not helping.
Leon: What do you mean I'm not helping?
Holden: I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? (pause) They're
just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.
(pause) Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good
things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.
Leon: Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
[cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on Deckard, reading a
newspaper]
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate...
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...
Deckard (voice-over): They don't advertise for killers in the
newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer.
Overhead blimp: Use your new friend as a
[Deckard walks over to Chinese carry-out stand]
Deckard: Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.
Deckard (voice over): Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold
fish.
Gaff: Hey, idi-wa.
Chinese dude: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.
Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?
[scene change...] [Deckard uses the machine thing]
Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57
to 19. Track 45 left. Stop. Enhance 15 to 23. Give me a hard copy
right there.
[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.

Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a

to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.

Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.

Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.

you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!

Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?
[scene change...] [Deckard uses the machine thing]
Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57
to 19. Track 45 left. Stop. Enhance 15 to 23. Give me a hard copy
right there.
[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.

Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.
Gaff: You've done a man's job, sir. I guess your through, huh?
Deckard: Finished.
Gaff: Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
Deckard: Rachael? Rachael? Rachael?
[Deckard uncovers Rachael.]
Deckard: Do you love me?
Rachael: I love you.
Deckard: Do you trust me?

can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.

Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.

Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.

wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional

Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?

Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.

inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?

Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.

Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.

are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you

being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?

Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.

Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know

[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?

Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?

Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?
[scene change...] [Deckard uses the machine thing]
Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57

[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.

questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.

Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.

Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!

takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.

straight.

Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...

Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.

Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.
Gaff: You've done a man's job, sir. I guess your through, huh?
Deckard: Finished.
Gaff: Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?

Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.

of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.
Gaff: You've done a man's job, sir. I guess your through, huh?
Deckard: Finished.
Gaff: Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
Deckard: Rachael? Rachael? Rachael?
[Deckard uncovers Rachael.]
Deckard: Do you love me?
Rachael: I love you.
Deckard: Do you trust me?
Rachael: I trust you.
Deckard: Rachael?
[Deckard picks up paper unicorn.]
Gaff (memory): Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
Deckard (voice-over): Gaff had been there, and let her live. Four
years, he figured. He was wrong. Tyrell had told me Rachael was
special: no termination date. I didn't know how long we had together,
.
638,725d

were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?
[scene change...] [Deckard uses the machine thing]
Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57

right there.
[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?

just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.
(pause) Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good
things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.
Leon: Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
[cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on Deckard, reading a
newspaper]
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate...
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...
Deckard (voice-over): They don't advertise for killers in the
newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer.
Overhead blimp: Use your new friend as a
[Deckard walks over to Chinese carry-out stand]
Deckard: Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.
Deckard (voice over): Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold
fish.
Gaff: Hey, idi-wa.
Chinese dude: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.
Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?

Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.

Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.

Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.

Holden: One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon: That's the hotel.
Holden: What?
Leon: Where I live.
Holden: Nice place?
Leon: Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden: No, just warming you up, that's all.
Leon: Oh. It's not fancy or anything.
Holden: You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of the
sudden-
Leon: Is this the test now?
Holden: Yes. You're in a desert walking along in the sand when all of
the sudden you look down-
Leon: What one?
Holden: What?
Leon: What desert?
Holden: It doesn't make any difference what desert, it's completely
hypothetical.
Leon: But how come I'd be there?
Holden: Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself, who
knows? You look down and you see a tortoise, Leon, it's crawling
toward you-
Leon: Tortoise, what's that?
Holden: Know what a turtle is?
Leon: Of course.
Holden: Same thing.
Leon: I've never seen a turtle. (pause) But I understand what you
mean.
Holden: You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.
Leon: Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write
them down for you?
Holden: The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without
your help, but you're not helping.
Leon: What do you mean I'm not helping?
Holden: I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? (pause) They're
just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.
(pause) Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good
things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.
Leon: Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)

Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a

Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.

bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.

Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?

Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.

brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.

else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad

home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.

to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect

Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.

[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.

Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.

eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?

Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers

Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...

Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.

Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--

Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.
Gaff: You've done a man's job, sir. I guess your through, huh?
Deckard: Finished.
Gaff: Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
Deckard: Rachael? Rachael? Rachael?
[Deckard uncovers Rachael.]
Deckard: Do you love me?

for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.
(pause) Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good
things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.
Leon: Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
[cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on Deckard, reading a
newspaper]
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate...
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...
Deckard (voice-over): They don't advertise for killers in the
newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer.
Overhead blimp: Use your new friend as a
[Deckard walks over to Chinese carry-out stand]
Deckard: Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.
Deckard (voice over): Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold
fish.
Gaff: Hey, idi-wa.
Chinese dude: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.
Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?

Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!

Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?

Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]

herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.

they?

Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.

caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury

filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.

Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?

Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.

Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.

Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.

Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.

Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?

Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?
[scene change...] [Deckard uses the machine thing]
Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57
to 19. Track 45 left. Stop. Enhance 15 to 23. Give me a hard copy
right there.
[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.

[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.

Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not

were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.

Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.

Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?

Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.

Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody

joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.

ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)

Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.

Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...
Deckard (voice-over): They don't advertise for killers in the

Deckard: Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.
Deckard (voice over): Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold

Gaff: Hey, idi-wa.
Chinese dude: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.
Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.

Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.

shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).

Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.

Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.

in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.

let's go.

Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.

Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,

Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.

[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.

Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?

Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]

Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.

they?

[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?

[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same

[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.

just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.
Gaff: You've done a man's job, sir. I guess your through, huh?
Deckard: Finished.
Gaff: Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?

Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury

Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.

Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.

Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...

Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to

Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.

Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.

Rachael: I love you.
Deckard: Do you trust me?
Rachael: I trust you.

Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.

Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody

home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]

Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.

Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know

follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.

chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.

Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...

newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer.

Deckard: Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.

Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.

Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.

Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.

Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse

Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place

let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.

Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.

Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.

department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
.

Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.
Gaff: You've done a man's job, sir. I guess your through, huh?
Deckard: Finished.
Gaff: Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
Deckard: Rachael? Rachael? Rachael?

Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.

Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.

[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.
Gaff: You've done a man's job, sir. I guess your through, huh?
Deckard: Finished.
Gaff: Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
Deckard: Rachael? Rachael? Rachael?
[Deckard uncovers Rachael.]
Deckard: Do you love me?

Holden: It doesn't make any difference what desert, it's completely
hypothetical.
Leon: But how come I'd be there?
Holden: Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself, who
knows? You look down and you see a tortoise, Leon, it's crawling
toward you-
Leon: Tortoise, what's that?
Holden: Know what a turtle is?
Leon: Of course.
Holden: Same thing.
Leon: I've never seen a turtle. (pause) But I understand what you
mean.
Holden: You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.
Leon: Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write
them down for you?
Holden: The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without
your help, but you're not helping.
Leon: What do you mean I'm not helping?
Holden: I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? (pause) They're
just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.

things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.

chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate...
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...
Deckard (voice-over): They don't advertise for killers in the
newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer.
Overhead blimp: Use your new friend as a

Deckard: Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.
Deckard (voice over): Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold
fish.

Chinese dude: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.
Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.

Holden: (hears knock on door) Come in. (pause) Sit down.
Leon: Care if I talk? I'm kind of nervous when I take tests.
Holden: Uh, just please don't move.
Leon: Oh, sorry. I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think
I've ever had one of these-
Holden: Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.
Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon: Sure.
Holden: One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon: That's the hotel.
Holden: What?
Leon: Where I live.
Holden: Nice place?
Leon: Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden: No, just warming you up, that's all.
Leon: Oh. It's not fancy or anything.
Holden: You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of the
sudden-
Leon: Is this the test now?
Holden: Yes. You're in a desert walking along in the sand when all of
the sudden you look down-
Leon: What one?
Holden: What?
Leon: What desert?
Holden: It doesn't make any difference what desert, it's completely
hypothetical.
Leon: But how come I'd be there?
Holden: Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself, who
knows? You look down and you see a tortoise, Leon, it's crawling
toward you-
Leon: Tortoise, what's that?
Holden: Know what a turtle is?
Leon: Of course.
Holden: Same thing.
Leon: I've never seen a turtle. (pause) But I understand what you
mean.
Holden: You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.
Leon: Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write
them down for you?
Holden: The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without
your help, but you're not helping.
Leon: What do you mean I'm not helping?
Holden: I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? (pause) They're
just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down

Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.

she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?

Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.
Gaff: You've done a man's job, sir. I guess your through, huh?
Deckard: Finished.
Gaff: Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
Deckard: Rachael? Rachael? Rachael?
[Deckard uncovers Rachael.]
Deckard: Do you love me?
Rachael: I love you.
Deckard: Do you trust me?
Rachael: I trust you.
Deckard: Rachael?
[Deckard picks up paper unicorn.]
Gaff (memory): Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
Deckard (voice-over): Gaff had been there, and let her live. Four

Deckard: Do you trust me?
Rachael: I trust you.
Deckard: Rachael?
[Deckard picks up paper unicorn.]
Gaff (memory): Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
Deckard (voice-over): Gaff had been there, and let her live. Four
years, he figured. He was wrong. Tyrell had told me Rachael was
special: no termination date. I didn't know how long we had together,
who does?
THE END

Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?
[scene change...] [Deckard uses the machine thing]
Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57
to 19. Track 45 left. Stop. Enhance 15 to 23. Give me a hard copy
right there.
[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.

LOS ANGELES
NOVEMBER, 2019
Intercom: Next subject, Kowalski, Leon, engineer, waste-disposal,
file- section, new employees, six days.
Holden: (hears knock on door) Come in. (pause) Sit down.
Leon: Care if I talk? I'm kind of nervous when I take tests.
Holden: Uh, just please don't move.
Leon: Oh, sorry. I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think
I've ever had one of these-
Holden: Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.
Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon: Sure.
Holden: One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon: That's the hotel.
Holden: What?
Leon: Where I live.
Holden: Nice place?
Leon: Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden: No, just warming you up, that's all.
Leon: Oh. It's not fancy or anything.
Holden: You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of the
sudden-
Leon: Is this the test now?
Holden: Yes. You're in a desert walking along in the sand when all of
the sudden you look down-
Leon: What one?
Holden: What?
Leon: What desert?
Holden: It doesn't make any difference what desert, it's completely
hypothetical.
Leon: But how come I'd be there?
Holden: Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself, who
knows? You look down and you see a tortoise, Leon, it's crawling
toward you-
Leon: Tortoise, what's that?
Holden: Know what a turtle is?
Leon: Of course.
Holden: Same thing.
Leon: I've never seen a turtle. (pause) But I understand what you
mean.
Holden: You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.
Leon: Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write
them down for you?
Holden: The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without
your help, but you're not helping.
Leon: What do you mean I'm not helping?
Holden: I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? (pause) They're
just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.
(pause) Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good
things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.
Leon: Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)

newspaper]
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate...
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...
Deckard (voice-over): They don't advertise for killers in the
newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer.
Overhead blimp: Use your new friend as a

Deckard: Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.
Deckard (voice over): Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold
fish.
Gaff: Hey, idi-wa.
Chinese dude: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.
Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that

Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.

Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?

Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.

Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.

Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!

Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.

Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?

Leon: What one?
Holden: What?
Leon: What desert?
Holden: It doesn't make any difference what desert, it's completely
hypothetical.
Leon: But how come I'd be there?
Holden: Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself, who
knows? You look down and you see a tortoise, Leon, it's crawling
toward you-
Leon: Tortoise, what's that?
Holden: Know what a turtle is?
Leon: Of course.
Holden: Same thing.
Leon: I've never seen a turtle. (pause) But I understand what you
mean.
Holden: You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.
Leon: Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write
them down for you?
Holden: The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without
your help, but you're not helping.
Leon: What do you mean I'm not helping?
Holden: I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? (pause) They're
just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.
(pause) Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good
things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.
Leon: Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)

newspaper]
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate...
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...
Deckard (voice-over): They don't advertise for killers in the
newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer.
Overhead blimp: Use your new friend as a
[Deckard walks over to Chinese carry-out stand]
Deckard: Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.
Deckard (voice over): Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold
fish.
Gaff: Hey, idi-wa.
Chinese dude: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.
Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.

in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The

Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?

them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.

Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.
Gaff: You've done a man's job, sir. I guess your through, huh?
Deckard: Finished.
Gaff: Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
Deckard: Rachael? Rachael? Rachael?
[Deckard uncovers Rachael.]
Deckard: Do you love me?
.

534,812c
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?
[scene change...] [Deckard uses the machine thing]
Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57
to 19. Track 45 left. Stop. Enhance 15 to 23. Give me a hard copy
right there.
[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and

Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.

[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?

Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.

Holden: Nice place?
Leon: Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden: No, just warming you up, that's all.
Leon: Oh. It's not fancy or anything.
Holden: You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of the
sudden-
Leon: Is this the test now?
Holden: Yes. You're in a desert walking along in the sand when all of
the sudden you look down-
Leon: What one?
Holden: What?
Leon: What desert?
Holden: It doesn't make any difference what desert, it's completely
hypothetical.
Leon: But how come I'd be there?
Holden: Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself, who
knows? You look down and you see a tortoise, Leon, it's crawling
toward you-
Leon: Tortoise, what's that?
Holden: Know what a turtle is?
Leon: Of course.
Holden: Same thing.
Leon: I've never seen a turtle. (pause) But I understand what you
mean.
Holden: You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.
Leon: Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write
them down for you?
Holden: The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without
your help, but you're not helping.
Leon: What do you mean I'm not helping?
Holden: I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? (pause) They're
just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.
(pause) Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good
things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.
Leon: Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)

chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.

Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?
[scene change...] [Deckard uses the machine thing]
Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57
to 19. Track 45 left. Stop. Enhance 15 to 23. Give me a hard copy
right there.
[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
.

275,375c
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)

those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?

Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.

Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay

Leon (video): Sure.

[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?
[scene change...] [Deckard uses the machine thing]
Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57

right there.
[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an

that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.

Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.

Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?

Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury

again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]

were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.

Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.

straight.

gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.

Roy: Yes...

alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.

Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.

Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?

was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.

[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.

Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you

(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.

Holden: The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without
your help, but you're not helping.
Leon: What do you mean I'm not helping?
Holden: I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? (pause) They're
just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.
(pause) Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good
things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.
Leon: Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)

newspaper]

chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate...
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...
Deckard (voice-over): They don't advertise for killers in the
newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer.
Overhead blimp: Use your new friend as a
[Deckard walks over to Chinese carry-out stand]
Deckard: Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.
Deckard (voice over): Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold
fish.
Gaff: Hey, idi-wa.
Chinese dude: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.
Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.

Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.

Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.

**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?
[scene change...] [Deckard uses the machine thing]
Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57
to 19. Track 45 left. Stop. Enhance 15 to 23. Give me a hard copy
right there.
[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort

Leon: Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write
them down for you?
Holden: The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without
your help, but you're not helping.
Leon: What do you mean I'm not helping?
Holden: I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? (pause) They're
just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.
(pause) Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good
things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.
Leon: Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
[cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on Deckard, reading a
newspaper]
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate...
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...
Deckard (voice-over): They don't advertise for killers in the
newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer.
Overhead blimp: Use your new friend as a
[Deckard walks over to Chinese carry-out stand]
Deckard: Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.
Deckard (voice over): Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold
fish.
Gaff: Hey, idi-wa.
Chinese dude: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.
Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing

know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.

Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.

in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.

Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!

Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.

Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?

follows, after tossing a bird.]

Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.

worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?

Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.

Leon: Oh, sorry. I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think
I've ever had one of these-
Holden: Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.
Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon: Sure.
Holden: One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon: That's the hotel.
Holden: What?
Leon: Where I live.
Holden: Nice place?
Leon: Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden: No, just warming you up, that's all.
Leon: Oh. It's not fancy or anything.
Holden: You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of the
sudden-
Leon: Is this the test now?
Holden: Yes. You're in a desert walking along in the sand when all of
the sudden you look down-
Leon: What one?
Holden: What?
Leon: What desert?
Holden: It doesn't make any difference what desert, it's completely
hypothetical.
Leon: But how come I'd be there?
Holden: Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself, who
knows? You look down and you see a tortoise, Leon, it's crawling
toward you-
Leon: Tortoise, what's that?
Holden: Know what a turtle is?
Leon: Of course.
Holden: Same thing.
Leon: I've never seen a turtle. (pause) But I understand what you
mean.
Holden: You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.
Leon: Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write
them down for you?
Holden: The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without
your help, but you're not helping.
Leon: What do you mean I'm not helping?
Holden: I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? (pause) They're
just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.
(pause) Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good
things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.
Leon: Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
[cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on Deckard, reading a
newspaper]
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate...
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...
Deckard (voice-over): They don't advertise for killers in the
newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer.
Overhead blimp: Use your new friend as a
[Deckard walks over to Chinese carry-out stand]
Deckard: Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.
Deckard (voice over): Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold
fish.
Gaff: Hey, idi-wa.
Chinese dude: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.
Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.

know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.

Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57

[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.

Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is

Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?

[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!

**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57

right there.
[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.

for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.

things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.
Leon: Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)

newspaper]

chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate...
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...
Deckard (voice-over): They don't advertise for killers in the
newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer.
Overhead blimp: Use your new friend as a
[Deckard walks over to Chinese carry-out stand]
Deckard: Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.
Deckard (voice over): Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold
fish.
Gaff: Hey, idi-wa.
Chinese dude: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.
Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't

New climate, recreation facilities...

Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:

Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.

not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.

Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?
[scene change...] [Deckard uses the machine thing]
Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57
to 19. Track 45 left. Stop. Enhance 15 to 23. Give me a hard copy
right there.
[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]

Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.

[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.

[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.

you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay

bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]

Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
.

are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57

right there.
[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm

Leon: Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write
them down for you?
Holden: The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without
your help, but you're not helping.
Leon: What do you mean I'm not helping?
Holden: I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? (pause) They're
just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.
(pause) Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good
things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.
Leon: Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
[cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on Deckard, reading a
newspaper]
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate...
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...
Deckard (voice-over): They don't advertise for killers in the
newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer.
Overhead blimp: Use your new friend as a
[Deckard walks over to Chinese carry-out stand]
Deckard: Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.
Deckard (voice over): Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold
fish.
Gaff: Hey, idi-wa.
Chinese dude: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.
Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?
[scene change...] [Deckard uses the machine thing]
Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57
to 19. Track 45 left. Stop. Enhance 15 to 23. Give me a hard copy
right there.
[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an

Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.

Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not

before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.

Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.

Rachael.

Lady: Yeah.

Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you

Deckard: I'm going home.

let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.

Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.

Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.

Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.

Deckard: Fish?

Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.

Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!

Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.

[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]

Holden: What?
Leon: Where I live.
Holden: Nice place?
Leon: Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden: No, just warming you up, that's all.
Leon: Oh. It's not fancy or anything.
Holden: You're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of the
sudden-
Leon: Is this the test now?
Holden: Yes. You're in a desert walking along in the sand when all of
the sudden you look down-
Leon: What one?
Holden: What?
Leon: What desert?
Holden: It doesn't make any difference what desert, it's completely
hypothetical.
Leon: But how come I'd be there?
Holden: Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself, who
knows? You look down and you see a tortoise, Leon, it's crawling
toward you-
Leon: Tortoise, what's that?
Holden: Know what a turtle is?
Leon: Of course.
Holden: Same thing.
Leon: I've never seen a turtle. (pause) But I understand what you
mean.
Holden: You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.
Leon: Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write
them down for you?
Holden: The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without
your help, but you're not helping.
Leon: What do you mean I'm not helping?
Holden: I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? (pause) They're
just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.
(pause) Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good
things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.
Leon: Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)

Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?

Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.

herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.

Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.

just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.
(pause) Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good
things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.
Leon: Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
[cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on Deckard, reading a
newspaper]
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate...
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...
Deckard (voice-over): They don't advertise for killers in the
newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer.
Overhead blimp: Use your new friend as a
[Deckard walks over to Chinese carry-out stand]
Deckard: Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.
Deckard (voice over): Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold
fish.
Gaff: Hey, idi-wa.
Chinese dude: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.
Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)

Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.

Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.

corrupted man.

Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does

Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be

mean.
Holden: You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.
Leon: Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write
them down for you?
Holden: The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without
your help, but you're not helping.
Leon: What do you mean I'm not helping?
Holden: I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? (pause) They're
just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.
(pause) Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good
things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.
Leon: Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
[cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on Deckard, reading a
newspaper]
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate...
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...
Deckard (voice-over): They don't advertise for killers in the
newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer.
Overhead blimp: Use your new friend as a
[Deckard walks over to Chinese carry-out stand]
Deckard: Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.
Deckard (voice over): Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold
fish.
Gaff: Hey, idi-wa.
Chinese dude: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.
Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?

shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).

Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you

workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.

Holden: Yes. You're in a desert walking along in the sand when all of
the sudden you look down-
Leon: What one?
Holden: What?
Leon: What desert?
Holden: It doesn't make any difference what desert, it's completely
hypothetical.
Leon: But how come I'd be there?
Holden: Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself, who
knows? You look down and you see a tortoise, Leon, it's crawling
toward you-
Leon: Tortoise, what's that?
Holden: Know what a turtle is?
Leon: Of course.
Holden: Same thing.
Leon: I've never seen a turtle. (pause) But I understand what you
mean.
Holden: You reach down, you flip the tortoise over on its back Leon.
Leon: Do you make up these questions, Mr. Holden, or do they write
them down for you?
Holden: The tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun
beating its legs trying to turn itself over but it can't, not without
your help, but you're not helping.
Leon: What do you mean I'm not helping?
Holden: I mean, you're not helping. Why is that Leon? (pause) They're
just questions, Leon. In answer to your query, they're written down
for me. It's a test, designed to provoke an emotional response.
(pause) Shall we continue? Describe in single words, only the good
things that come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon: My mother?
Holden: Yeah.
Leon: Let me tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
[cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on Deckard, reading a
newspaper]
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate...
Overhead blimp: A new life awaits you in the off-world colonies, the
chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure.
New climate, recreation facilities...
Deckard (voice-over): They don't advertise for killers in the
newspaper. That was my profession. Ex-cop, ex-bladerunner, ex-killer.
Overhead blimp: Use your new friend as a
[Deckard walks over to Chinese carry-out stand]
Deckard: Give me four. No, two, two, four. And noodles.
Deckard (voice over): Sushi, that's what my ex-wife called me. Cold
fish.
Gaff: Hey, idi-wa.
Chinese dude: He say you under arrest, Mr. Deckard.
Deckard: Got the wrong guy, pal.
Gaff:
Chinese dude: He say you blade runner.
Deckard: Tell him I'm eating.
Gaff:
Deckard: Bryant, huh?
[Deckard and Gaff take off vertically in spinner to see Bryant.]
Spinner: climb and maintain 4000 ... when approaching pad six ...
Deckard (voice-over): The charmer's name was Gaff. I'd seen him
around. Bryant must have upped him to the Blade Runner unit. That
gibberish he talked was city-speak, guttertalk, a mishmash of
Japanese, Spanish, German, what have you. I didn't really need a
translator. I knew the lingo, every good cop did. But I wasn't going
to make it easier for him.
Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.

Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.

replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.

[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.

in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.

[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.

Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.

takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.
Gaff: You've done a man's job, sir. I guess your through, huh?
Deckard: Finished.
Gaff: Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
Deckard: Rachael? Rachael? Rachael?

Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?

Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?

Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.

Spinner: ...now on glide path, on course, over the landing threshold.
[Bryant's office]
Bryant: Hiya Deck.
Deckard: Bryant.
Bryant: You wouldn't have come if I just asked you to. Sit down pal.
C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?

C'mon don't be an asshole Deckard. I've got four skin jobs walking the
streets.
Deckard (voice-over): Skin jobs, that's what Bryant called replicants.
In history books he was the kind of cop that used to call black men
niggers.
Bryant: They jumped a shuttle off world killed the crew and
passengers. They found the shuttle drifting off the coast two weeks
ago so we know they're around.
Deckard: Embarrassing.
Bryant: No sir. Not embarrassing, because no one's ever going to find
out they're down here. Because you're going to spot them, and you're
going to air them out.
Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.
--- [Video room]
Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.

Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.

Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few

Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.

Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.
Gaff: You've done a man's job, sir. I guess your through, huh?
Deckard: Finished.
Gaff: Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
Deckard: Rachael? Rachael? Rachael?
[Deckard uncovers Rachael.]
Deckard: Do you love me?
.
301,355d
253,745c
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?
[scene change...] [Deckard uses the machine thing]
Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.
Enhance 34 to 46. Pull back. Wait a minute, go right, stop. Enhance 57

right there.
[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
.
452,529d
863,1112c
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?
[scene change...] [Deckard uses the machine thing]
Deckard: Enhance 224 to 176. Enhance, stop. Move in, stop. Pull out,
track right, stop. Center in, pull back. Stop. Track 45 right. Stop.
Center and stop. Enhance 34 to 36. Pan right and pull back. Stop.

[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.

Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...

replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.

Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.

Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.

Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.

Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.

Decakrd: I don't work here anymore. Give it to Holden, he's good.
Bryant: I did. He can breath okay as long as nobody unplugs him. He's
not good enough, not as good as you. I need you, Deck. This is a bad
one, the worse yet. I need the old bladerunner, I need your magic.
Deckard: I was quit when I came in here. I'm twice as quit now.
Bryant: Stop right where you are. You know the score pal. If you're
not cop, you're little people.
Deckard: No choice, huh?
Bryant: No choice pal.

Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--

Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)

Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.

herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.

Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]

[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same

from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?

department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.

in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.

left on the sidewalk.

let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.

Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.

Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
Roy: That hurt. That was irrational. Not to mention, unsportsman like.
Ha ha ha. Where are you going?
[Deckard does some amazing climbing, then jumps to next building. Roy
follows, after tossing a bird.]
Roy: Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is
to be a slave.
[Deckard falls, Roy catches him.]
Roy: I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on
fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the
darkness at Tan Hauser Gate. All those moments will be lost in time
like tears in rain. Time to die.
Deckard (voice-over): I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in
those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not
just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same
answers the rest of us want. Where did I come from? Where am I going?
How long have I got? All I could do was sit there and watch him die.
Gaff: You've done a man's job, sir. I guess your through, huh?
Deckard: Finished.
Gaff: Its too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?
Deckard: Rachael? Rachael? Rachael?
[Deckard uncovers Rachael.]
Deckard: Do you love me?
Rachael: I love you.

Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.

Leon (video): I already had an IQ test this year, I don't think I've
ever had one of these-
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Yeah, sure.
Holden (video): 1-1-8-7 at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, that's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--
Bryant: There was an escape from the off-world colonies two weeks ago.
Six replicants, three male, three female. They slaughtered
twenty-three people and jumped a shuttle. An aerial patrol spotted the
ship off the coast. No crew, no sight of them. Three nights ago they
tried to break into Tyrell Corporation. One of them got fried running
through an electrical field. We lost the others. On the possibility
they might try to infiltrate his employees, I had Holden go over and
run Voight-Kampff tests on the new workers. Looks like he got himself
one.
Holden (video): So you look down you see a tortoise. It's crawling
toward you.
Leon (video): Tortoise, what's that?
Holden (video): Know what a turtle is?
Leon (video): Of course.
Holden (video): Same thing.
Leon (video): I've never seen a turtle.
Deckard: I don't get it. What do they risk coming back to earth for?
That's unusual. Why--what do they want from the Tyrell Corporation?
Bryant: Well you tell me pal, that's what you're here for.
Deckard: [funny look]. [pause] What's this?
Bryant: Nexus 6. Roy Batty. Incept date 2016. Combat model. Optimum
self-sufficiency. Probably the leader. This is Zhora. She's trained
for an off-world kick-murder squad. Talk about beauty and the beast,
she's both. The fourth skin job is Pris. A basic pleasure model. The
standard item for military clubs in the outer colonies. They were
designed to copy human beings in every way except their emotions. The
designers reckoned that after a few years they might develop their own
emotional responses. You know, hate, love, fear, envy. So they built
in a fail-safe device.
Deckard: Which is what?
Bryant: Four year life span.
Bryant: Now there's a Nexus 6 over at the Tyrell Corporation. I want
you to go put the machine on it.
Deckard: And if the machine doesn't work?
[Deckard flies to the enormous Tyrell building]
Deckard (voice-over): I'd quit because I'd had a belly full of
killing. But then I'd rather be a killer than a victim. And that's
exactly what Bryant's threat about little people meant. So I hooked in
once more, thinking that if I couldn't take it, I'd split later. I
didn't have to worry about Gaff. He was brown-nosing for a promotion,
so he didn't want me back anyway.
[inside the Tyrell building--looks faintly Egyptian]
Rachael: Do you like our owl?
Deckard: It's artificial?
Rachael: Of course it is.
Deckard: Must be expensive.
Rachael: Very. I'm Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard.
Rachael: It seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public.
Deckard: Replicants are like any other machine. They're either a
benefit or a hazard. If they're a benefit, it's not my problem.
Rachael: May I ask you a personal question?
Deckard: Sure.
Rachael: Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Deckard: No.
Rachael: But in your position that is a risk?
Tyrell: Is this to be an empathy test? Capillary dilation of the
so-called blush response? Fluctuation of the pupil? Involuntary
dilation of the iris?
Deckard: We call it Voight-Kampff for short.
Rachael: Mr. Deckard, Dr. Eldon Tyrell.
Tyrell: Demonstrate it. I want to see it work.
Deckard: Where's the subject?
Tyrell: I want to see it work on a person. I want to see a negative
before I provide you with a positive.
Deckard: What's that going to prove?
Tyrell: Indulge me.
Deckard: On you?
Tyrell: Try her.
Deckard: It's too bright in here.
[the window changes shade, letting less light in]
Rachael: Do you mind if I smoke?
Deckard: It won't affect the test. Alright, I'm going to ask you a
series of questions. Just relax and answer them as simply as you can.
(pause) It's your birthday. Someone gives you a calfskin wallet.
Rachael: I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it
to me to the police.
Deckard: You've got a little boy. He shows you his butterfly
collection plus the killing jar.
Rachael: I take him to the doctor.
Deckard: You're watching television. Suddenly you realize there's a
wasp crawling on your arm.
Rachael: I'd kill it.
Deckard: You're reading a magazine. You come across a full-page nude
photo of a girl.
Rachael: Is this testing whether I'm a replicant or a lesbian, Mr.
Deckard?
Deckard: Just answer the questions, please. (pause) You show it to
your husband. He likes it so much he hangs it on your bedroom wall.
Deckard (background): bush outside your window
Rachael: I wouldn't let him.
Deckard (background): orange body, green legs
Deckard: Why not?
Rachael: I should be enough for him.
[audio fades out and in, time passes.]
Deckard: One more question. You're watching a stage play. A banquet is
in progress. The guests are enjoying an appetizer of raw oysters. The
entree consists of boiled dog.
Tyrell: Would you step out for a few moments, Rachael? (pause) Thank
you.
Deckard: She's a replicant, isn't she?
Tyrell: I'm impressed. How many questions does it usually take to spot
them?
Deckard: I don't get it Tyrell.
Tyrell: How many questions?
Deckard: Twenty, thirty, cross-referenced.
Tyrell: It took more than a hundred for Rachael, didn't it?
Deckard: She doesn't know?!
Tyrell: She's beginning to suspect, I think.
Deckard: Suspect? How can it not know what it is?
Tyrell: Commerce, is our goal here at Tyrell. More human than human is
our motto. Rachael is an experiment, nothing more. We began to
recognize in them strange obsessions. After all they are emotional
inexperienced with only a few years in which to store up the
experiences which you and I take for granted. If we give them the past
we create a cushion or pillow for their emotions and consequently we
can control them better.
Deckard: Memories. You're talking about memories.
[Deckard and Gaff drive to Leon's apartment in spinner, watching
Leon's video.]
Holden (video): Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay
attention. Now, answer as quickly as you can.
Leon (video): Sure.
Holden (video): One-one-eight-seven at Hunter-Vasser.
Leon (video): Yeah, That's the hotel.
Holden (video): What?
Leon (video): Where I live.
Holden (video): Nice place?
Leon (video): Yeah, sure I guess--that part of the test?
Holden (video): No--
[Deckard and Gaff inspect the apartment. Deckard finds a scale in the
bathtub and some family photos. Gaff watches quietly, folding an
origami statue of a man with an erection.]
Deckard (voice-over): I didn't know whether Leon gave Holden a legit
address. But it was the only lead I had, so I checked it out. Whatever
was in the bathtub was not human. Replicants don't have scales. And
family photos? Replicants didn't have families either.
[Leon meets Roy outside of phonebooth]
Roy: Time enough. (pause) Did you get your precious photos?
Leon: Someone was there.
Roy: Man? (pause) Policeman?
[Roy and Leon enter Chew's laboratory]
Chew: (mumbles to himself) (pause) (screaming)
Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?
[In spinner, listening to Leon's video]
Holden (video): Describe in single words, only the good things that
come in to your mind about: your mother.
Leon (video): My mother?
Holden (video): Yeah.
Leon (video): I'll tell you about my mother. (shot fired)
**** is this right ****? [cut to overhead shot of city, zooms in on
Deckard, reading a newspaper]
Elevator: Voice print identification. Your floor number please.
Deckard: Deckard, ninety-seven.
Elevator: Ninety-seven, thank-you, danke.
Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect
photos. Maybe they were like Rachael. They needed memories.
[Deckard, on balcony.]
[Switch to Pris. Outside J. F. Sebastians's apartment building. Covers
herself in trash pile.]
Pris: Pugh... Uhhh... Ungh... Ungh...
Sebastian: Hey! You forgot your bag.
Pris: I'm lost.
Sebastian: Don't worry, I won't hurt you. (pause) What's your name?
Pris: Pris.
Sebastian: Mine's J. F. Sebastian.
Pris: Hi.
Sebastian: Hi. Oh, where were you going? Home?
Pris: I don't have one. We scared each other pretty good, didn't we?
Sebastian: We sure did.
Pris: I'm hungry J. F.
Sebastian: I've got some stuff inside. You want to come in?
Pris: I was hoping you'd say that.
[Pris and Sebastian enter building.]
Pris: Do you live in this building all by yourself?
Sebastian: Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now. No housing
shortage around here. Plenty of room for everybody. (pause)
Pris: (cough).
Sebastian: Watch out for the water.
Pris: Must get lonely here J. F.
Sebastian: Mmm... Not really. I make friends. They're toys. My friends
are toys. I make them. It's a hobby. I'm a genetic designer. Do you
know what that is?
Pris: No.
Sebastian: Yoo-hoo, home again.
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Sebastian: Good evening, fellas.
Toy 1: Oooh!
Sebastian: They're my friends. I made them. Where are you're folks?
Pris: I'm sort of an orphan.
Sebastian: Oh, what about your friends?
Pris: I have some, but I have to find them. I'll let 'em know where I
am tomorrow.
Sebastian: Oh. Can I take those things for you? They're soaked aren't
they?

[Market]
Deckard: Fish?
Lady: I think it was manufactured. Look. Finest quality. Superior
workmanship. There is a maker's serial number 9906947-XB71.
Interesting. Not fish. Snake scale.
Deckard: Snake?
Lady: Try Abdul ben Hassan. He make this snake.
[Abdul Hassan's]
Deckard: Abdul Hassan? I'm a police officer, I'd like to ask you a few
questions. Artificial snake license XB71, that's you? This is your
work, huh? Who did you sell it to?
Abdul: My work? Not too many could afford such quality.
Deckard: How many?
Abdul: Very few.
Deckard: How few? Look my friend.
Abdul: Taffy Lewis, down in first sector, Chinatown.
[Taffy Lewis's]
Deckard: Bartender? Taffy Lewis? Taffy, I'd like to ask you a few
questions.
Taffy: Blow me.
Deckard: You ever buy snakes from the Egyptian, Taffy?
Taffy: All the time, pal.
Deckard: Every see this girl, huh?
Taffy: Never seen her, buzz off.
Deckard: Your licenses in order pal?
Taffy: Hey Louie, the man is dry. Give him one on the house. See ya.
[Deckard calls Rachael on a public videophone.]
Rachael: Hello?
Deckard: I've had people walk out on me before, but not when I was
being so charming. I'm at a bar here now down at the Fourth Sector.
Taffy Lewis is on the line. Why don't you come on down here and have a
drink?
Roy: I don't think so, Mr. Deckard. That's not my kind of place.
Deckard: Go someplace else?
[Deckard returns to the Taffy's]
Announcer: Ladies and Gentlemen. Taffy Lewis presents Miss Solamay and
the snake. Watch her take the pleasures from the serpent that once
corrupted man.
[Ms. Solamay's dressing room.]
Deckard: Excuse me, Ms. Solamay, can I talk to you for a minute? I'm
from the American Federation of Variety Artists.
Zhora: Oh, yeah?
Deckard: I'm not here to make you join. No ma'am. That's not my
department. Actually, uh. I'm from the, uh, Confidential Committee on
Moral Abuses.
Zhora: Committee of Moral Abuses?
Deckard: Yes, ma'am. There's been some reports that the management has
been taking liberties with the artists in this place.
Zhora: I don't know nothing about it.
Deckard: Have you felt yourself to be exploited in any way?
Zhora: How do you mean, exploited?
Deckard: Well, like to get this job. I mean, did you do, or-- or were
you asked to do anything that was lewd or unsavory or otherwise, uh,
repulsive to your person, huh?
Zhora: Ha. Are you for real?
Deckard: Oh yeah. I'd like to check your dressing room if I may.
Zhora: For what?
Deckard: For, uh, for holes.
Zhora: Holes?
Deckard: You'd be surprised what a guy'd go through to get a glimpse
of a beautiful body.
Zhora: No, I wouldn't.
Deckard: Little, uh, dirty holes, uh, they drill in the wall so they
can watch a lady undress. (pause) Is this a real snake?
Zhora: Of course it's not real. Do you think I'd be working in a place
like this if I could afford a real snake? (pause) So if somebody does
try to exploit me, who do I go to about it?
Deckard: Me.
Zhora: You're a dedicated man.
[Fight and chase]
Hari Krishnas: Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari. Hari, Hari.
Street Thing: Cross now... Don't walk...
Deckard: Move! Get out of the way!
[Deckard fires. Kills Zhora in dramatic slow motion scene.]
Deckard (voice-over): The report would be routine retirement of a
replicant which didn't make me feel any better about shooting a woman
in the back. There it was again. Feeling, in myself. For her, for
Rachael.
Deckard: Deckard. B-263-54.
Street thing: Move on...
Lady: Yeah what do you want?
Deckard: Tsing tao. This enough?
Lady: Yeah.
Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!

Roy: Fiery the angels fell. Deep thunder rode around their shores,
burning with the fires of Orc.
Chew: (stuff). You not come here. Illegal. (pause) Hey. Hey. Cold!
Those are my eyes! Freezing!
Roy: Yes, questions.
[Leon removes Chew's jacket.]
Roy: Morphology, longevity, incept dates.
Chew: Don't know -- I, I don't know such stuff. I just do eyes. Just
eyes -- Just genetic design of eyes -- just eyes. You Nexus, huh? I
design your eyes.
Roy: Chew, if only you could see what I've seen with your eyes.
Questions.
Chew: I don't know answers.
Roy: Who does?
Chew: Tyrell. He -- He knows everything.
Roy: Tyrell corporation?
Chew: He big boss. He genius. He design your mind, your brain.
Roy: Ah, smart.
Chew: Cold.
Roy: Not an easy man to see--
Chew: Very cold.
Roy: I guess?
Chew: Sebastian he take-- take you there.
Roy: Sebastian who?
Chew: J. -- J. F. Sebastian-- Sebas... Sebas...
Roy: Now--where would we find this J. F. Sebastian?

Rachael: I wanted to see you, (pause) so I waited. Let me help.
Deckard: What do I need help for?
Rachael: I don't know why he told you what he did.
Deckard: Talk to him.
Rachael: He wouldn't see me.
Deckard: Do you want a drink? No? No?
Rachael: You think I'm a replicant, don't you? (pause) Look, it's me
with my mother.
Deckard: Yeah. (pause) Remember when you were six? You and your
brother snuck into an empty building through a basement window--you
were gonna play doctor. He showed you his, but when it got to be your
turn you chickened and ran. Remember that? You ever tell anybody that?
Your mother, Tyrell, anybody? You remember the spider that lived in a
bush outside your window: orange body, green legs. Watched her build a
web all summer. Then one day there was a big egg in it. The egg
hatched--
Rachael: The egg hatched, and a hundred baby spiders came out. And
they ate her.
Deckard: Implants! Those aren't your memories. They're somebody
else's. They're Tyrell's niece's. (pause) Okay, bad joke. I made a bad
joke. You're not a replicant. Go home, okay? No really, I'm sorry. Go
home. (pause) Want a drink? I'll get you a drink.
[Rachael runs away when Deckard turns to get a glass.]
Deckard (voice-over): Tyrell really did a job on Rachael. Right down
to a snapshot of a mother she never had, a daughter she never was.
Replicants weren't supposed to have feelings. Neither were blade
runners. What the hell was happening to me? Leon's pictures had to be
as phony as Rachael's. I didn't know why a replicant would collect

Gaff: Bryant.
Bryant: Christ, Deckard, you look almost as bad as that skin job you
left on the sidewalk.
Deckard: I'm going home.
Bryant: You could learn from this guy Gaff. He's a god damn one man
slaughter house. That's what he is. Four more to go. Come on Gaff,
let's go.
Deckard: Three. There's three to go.
Bryant: There's four. That-- That skin job that you V-K'ed at the
Tyrell Corporation, Rachael. Disappeared. Vanished. Didn't even know
she was a replicant. Something to do with a brain implant says Tyrell.
Come on Gaff. Drink some for me, pal.
[Leon stops Deckard in the street]
Deckard: Leon.
Leon: How old am I?
Deckard: I don't know.
Leon: My birthday is April 10, 2017. How long do I live?
Deckard: Four years.
Leon: More than you. Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Nothing is
worse than having an itch you can never scratch.
Deckard: Oh, I agree.
Leon: Wake up! Time to die.
[Rachael pops some lead into Leon's cranium]
[Back at Deckard apartment]
Deckard: Shakes? Me too. I get 'em bad. It's part of the business.
Rachael: I'm not in the business. I am the business.
[Deckard gurgles blood.]
Rachael: What if I go north. Disappear. Would you come after me? Hunt
me?
Deckard: No. No, I wouldn't. I owe you one. But somebody would.
Rachael: Deckard? You know those files on me? The incept dates, the
longevity, those things. You saw them?
Deckard: They're classified.
Rachael: But you're a policeman.
Deckard: I didn't look at them.
Rachael: You know that Voight-Kampf test of yours? Did you ever take
that test yourself? Deckard?
[Deckard falls asleep while Rachael dis-hairs and plays the piano.]
Deckard: I dreamt music.
Rachael: I didn't know if I could play. I remember lessons. I don't
know if it's me or Tyrell's niece.
Deckard: You play beautifully.
[A little rough-housin']
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: I can't rely on.
Deckard: Say kiss me.
Rachael: Kiss me.
Deckard: I want you.
Rachael: I want you.
Deckard: Again.
Rachael: I want you. Put your hands on me.
[Sebastian's apartment.]
Sebastian: Whatcha doing?
Pris: Sorry, just peaking.
Sebastian: Oh.
Pris: How do I look?
Sebastian: You look better.
Pris: Just better?
Sebastian: Well, you look beautiful.
Pris: Thanks. (pause) How old are you?
Sebastian: Twenty-five.
Pris: What's you problem?
Sebastian: Methuselah's syndrome.
Pris: What's that?
Sebastian: My glands. They grow old too fast.
Pris: Is that why you're still on earth?
Sebastian: Yeah, I couldn't pass the medical. Anyway, I kind of like
it here.
Pris: I like you just the way you are. Hi Roy.
Roy: Ah, gosh. You've really got some nice toys here.
Pris: This is the friend I was telling you about. This is my savior J.
F. Sebastian.
Roy: Sebastian. I like a man that stays put. You live here all by
yourself, do ya?
Sebastian: Yes. (pause) How 'bout some breakfast. I was just gonna
make some.
Pris: Well?
Roy: Leon--
Pris: What's going on.
Roy: Ah-- There's only two of us now.
Pris: Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Roy: No we won't.
[Sebastian and Roy at chess board]
Sebastian: No, knight takes queen, see. No good.
Roy: Why are you staring at us Sebastian?
Sebastian: Because. You're so different. You're so perfect.
Roy: Yes.
Sebastian: What generation are you?
Roy: Nexus six.
Sebastian: Ah, I knew it. 'Cause I do genetic design work for the
Tyrell Corporation. There's some of me in you. Show me something.
Roy: Like what?
Sebastian: Like anything.
Roy: We're not computers Sebastian, we're physical.
Pris: I think, Sebastian, therefore I am.
Roy: Very good Pris, now show him why.
[Pris throws hot eggs at Sebastian]
Roy: We've got a lot in common.
Sebastian: What do you mean?
Roy: Similar problems.
Pris: Accelerated decrepitude.
Sebastian: I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy, I wish I did.
Roy: If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live. We
can't allow that. (pause) Is he good?
Sebastian: Who?
Roy: Your opponent.
Sebastian: Oh, Dr. Tyrell? I've only beaten him once in chess. He's a
genius. He designed you.
Roy: Maybe he could help.
Sebastian: I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Roy: Better if I talk to him in person. But I understand he's a sort
of hard man to get to.
Sebastian: Yes, very.
Roy: Will you help us?
Sebastian: I can't.
Pris: We need you Sebastian. You're our best and only friend.
Roy: (Goofy chinese accent) We're so happy you found us.
Pris: I don't think there's another human being in the whole world who
would have helped us.
[To Tyrell's house.]
Tyrell: 66 thousand Prosser and Ankovich. Hmmm.. Trade. Trade at--
Computer: New entry. A Mr. J. F. Sebastian. 1-6-4-1-7.
Tyrell: At this hour? What can I do for you Sebastian.
Sebastian: Queen to Bishop 6. Check.
Tyrell: Nonsense. Just a moment. Mmmm. Queen to Bishop 6. Ridiculous.
Queen to Bishop 6. Hmmm... Knight takes Queen. (pause) What's on your
mine Sebastian. What are you thinking about.
Roy: (whispered) Bishop to King 7.
Sebastian: Bishop to King 7. Check mate, I think.
Tyrell: Quite a brainstorm, uh, Sebastian. Milk and cookies kept you
awake, huh? Lets discuss this. You better come up, Sebastian.
Sebastian: Mr. Tyrell. I-- I brought a friend.
Tyrell: I'm surprised you didn't come here sooner.
Roy: It's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
Tyrell: What can he do for you?
Roy: Can the maker repair what he makes.
Tyrell: Would you like to be modified?
Roy: Stay here. (pause) I had in mind something a little more radical.
Tyrell: What-- What seems to be the problem?
Roy: Death.
Tyrell: Death. Well, I'm afraid that's a little out of my
jurisdiction, you--
Roy: I want more life, fucker.
Tyrell: The facts of life. To make an alteration in the evolvment of
an organic life system is fatal. A coding sequence cannot be revised
once it's been established.
Roy: Why not?
Tyrell: Because by the second day of incubation, any cells that have
undergone reversion mutations give rise to revertant colonies like
rats leaving a sinking ship. Then the ship sinks.
Roy: What about EMS recombination.
Tyrell: We've already tried it. Ethyl methane sulfanate as an
alkalating agent and potent mutagen. It created a virus so lethal the
subject was dead before he left the table.
Roy: Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
Tyrell: Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an
error in replication so that the newly formed DNA strand carries the
mutation and you've got a virus again. But, uh, this-- all of this is
academic. You were made as well as we could make you.
Roy: But not to last.
Tyrell: The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And
you have burned so very very brightly, Roy. Look at you. You're the
prodigal son. You're quite a prize!
Roy: I've done questionable things.
Tyrell: Also extraordinary things. Revel in your time.
Roy: Nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
[Tyrell screams as his eyes are gouged out.]
[On the street...]
Bryant: Body identified with Tyrell as a twenty-five year old male
caucasian named Sebastian. J. F. Sebastian. Address Bradbury
apartments, ninth sector. NM46751. I want you to go down there---
Cop: This sector's closed to ground traffic. What are you doing here?
Deckard: I'm working. What are you doing?
Cop: Arresting you. That's what I'm doing.
Deckard: I'm Deckard. Blade runner. Two sixty three-fifty four. I'm
filed and monitored ( Cop: Checking. (pause) Okay, checked and
cleared. Have a better one.
[Deckard calls Sebastian's apartment.]
Pris: Hello?
Deckard: Hi, is J. F. there?
Pris: Who is it?
Deckard: This is Eddie. An old friend of J. F.'s.
[Pris hangs up.]
Deckard: Ooh. That's no way to treat a friend.
[Deckard enters apartment.]
Toys: Home again, home again, jiggity jig. Good evening J. F.
Toy 1: Oooh!
[Lots o' background noise from the toys... Decakrd searches... He
takes off Pris's veil. Pris attacks, does the ole "head squishem
between the legs trick". Deckard blows some chunks into Pris...
again... again. Roy arrives. Deckard fires, but misses.]
Roy: Not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. I thought you
were supposed to be good. Aren't you the good man? Come on Deckard.
Show me what you're made of.
[Roy breaks through wall.]
Roy: Proud of yourself, little man? This is for Zhora.
Deckard: Arrggh.
Roy: This is for Pris.
Deckard: Arrgghh.
Roy: Come on, Deckard, I'm right here, but you've got to shoot
straight.
[Deckard fires again.]
Roy: Straight doesn't seem to be good enough. Now it's my turn. I'm
gonna give you a few seconds before I come. One, Two. Three, Four.
Pris...
Deckard: Arrghhh.
[Chase starts... Roy begins howling.]
Roy: (singing) I'm coming. (pause) Four, five. How to stay alive.
(pause) I can see you! (pause, grasping hand) Not yet. Not...
[Roy put stake through hand and screams.]
Roy: Yes...
[Roy puts head through wall.]
Roy: You better get it up, or I'm gonna have to kill ya! Unless your
alive, you can't play, and if you don't play... Six, seven. Go to
hell, go to heaven.
[Fight]
Roy: Yeah, that's the spirit.
[Deckard hits Roy with pipe.]
